    "**Production planning** is essential for the management of manufacturing to produce the right number of products to satisfy customer demand over a specific time horizon and maximize profit. Our final project is aiming to match production and sourcing decisions to meet market demand subject to production capacity, workforce availability, and overtime restrictions. The objective of the problem is to maximize the profit or minimize the total cost.\n",

    "We will solve this problem using two types of mathematical models:<br>\n",

    " 2. **Stochastic Production Planning Model**<br>\n",
    "In this approach, the demand 𝑑\" in a period of time is uncertain. However, we are given a set of probabilities associated with demand to find a solution that is feasible for all or almost all the possible data and optimizes the expected performance of the model.\n"

I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution.
